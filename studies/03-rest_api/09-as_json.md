- The methods are to be implement dynamically custom fields to all locales. Example:
- Go to app => models => contact.rb
- Add this code:

```ruby
  class Contact < ApplicationRecord
    def author
      "Lucca Rodrigues"
    end

    def as_json(options={})
      super(methods: :author)
    end
  end
```

- Now this is added to all locales where the module is available

```
